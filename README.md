# Bean-disease-screening-project
Creating a mobile, AI enabled Platform for screening of bean plant diseases

## Dataset
The dataset has been collected, from various districts in Uganda, in a joint effort between the Marconi Machine Learning Lab,  CEDAT, The Makerere AI Lab, CoCIS, and the National Crop Resources Research Institute, NaCRRI. 
Each image is associated with one of the three classes: Angular Leaf Spot (ALS), Bean Rust, and Healthy and for the disease classes, bounding boxes are drawn around the afflicted patches.

## Create a simple classification model
For our classification model, we used sample data from the dataset collected above as follows:

Class	            | Examples       |
------------------|----------------|
Healthy class	    | 400            |
Angular Leaf Spot |	400            |
Bean Rust	        | 400            |
Total:  	        | 1,200          |
## Make an EDA on the dataset

## Making a dashboard for model performance
